# zUI
World of Warcraft UI rework/tweaks for General activities, M+, Raids for a minimalistic style.

Because I'm bored of slow updates and overcomplicated ui panels.

God damnit if I want something overcomplicated I'll start to customize vim

Use `/zui` or `ESC` -> `zUI Settings` to show the settings panel (every setting is character specific)

    - Target on tooltip
